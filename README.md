# gameoff2020
Public repository for the itch.io 2020 Game Off jam

This game was originally made for an earlier version of Unity. Our fork intends to update it to version 2019.4.19f1.
Since this update breaks certain functionality, our fork also aims to modify the game to fix this.

Additionally, our plan is to add functionality to the game so that it's easier to tell when it is a good
time to build each building, and so that time progress can be made faster than the default speed and the
fast-forward speed.
